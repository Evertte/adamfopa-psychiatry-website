Telehealth visits are available when clinically appropriate. They follow the same paced, collaborative approach as in-person visits.

## Where telehealth is available
- Patients must be located in Massachusetts or New Hampshire at the time of the visit.
- Some situations may require an in-person follow-up; the provider will advise during scheduling.

## Preparing for your telehealth visit
- Choose a quiet, private space with reliable internet.
- Test your camera and audio before joining.
- Have your ID and current medication list available.
- Join a few minutes early to check your connection and resolve any audio or video issues.

## Security and privacy
- Video visits are hosted on a secure platform; we do not record sessions.
- Avoid sharing sensitive personal details over email or unencrypted channels.
- You will receive connection instructions after scheduling is confirmed.

## Telehealth vs. in-person
- Telehealth is often best for routine follow-ups and check-ins.
- In-person visits are available by appointment at 1097 Central Street, Leominster, MA if that setting is preferred or needed.
- Contact us if you are unsure which visit type is right for your situation.

## Emergencies
Telehealth visits are not for emergencies. If you are in crisis or concerned about immediate safety, call 911, go to the nearest emergency room, or contact 988.
